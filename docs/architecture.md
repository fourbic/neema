# Architecture Documentation

## Application Architecture

### Core Architecture
The Neema application follows a modern React application architecture with the following key characteristics:

1. **Component-Based Structure**
   - Modular components using functional components and hooks
   - Clear separation of concerns between UI components and business logic
   - Reusable component library built with Radix UI primitives

2. **State Management**
   - React Query for server state management
   - Local state management using React's useState and useContext
   - Clerk for authentication state management

3. **Routing**
   - React Router v6 for client-side routing
   - Protected route implementation for authenticated sections
   - Lazy loading support for route-based code splitting

### Directory Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Base UI components
│   └── [feature]/      # Feature-specific components
├── pages/              # Route components
├── lib/                # Utilities and configurations
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Clerk integration for secure authentication
   - Protected route wrapper for secure access
   - Waitlist system for controlled user access

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Atomic design principles
   - Composition over inheritance
   - Props drilling minimization using context

3. **Styling Approach**
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - CSS modules for component-specific styles
   - Theme customization support

4. **Data Flow**
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - React Query for server state management
   - Context API for global state

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Clerk-based authentication
   - Protected routes
   - Secure session management

2. **Data Protection**
   - Environment variable management
   - API key security
   - Input validation

### Performance Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Component lazy loading
   - Dynamic imports

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Image optimization
   - CSS minification
   - Tree shaking

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based directory structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent file naming conventions

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript for type checking
   - Interface definitions
   - Type guards

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Component testing
   - Integration testing
   - Unit testing

### Build and Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Vite for fast development and building
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Asset optimization

2. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - CI/CD integration
   - Environment management
   - Version control

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Micro-frontend architecture potential
   - Service worker implementation
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Maintenance**
   - Documentation updates
   - Dependency management
   - Code quality monitoring

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - API integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Advanced analytics
